# Tailwind CSS - Incorrect Content Path Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when setting up Tailwind CSS: classes not being recognized due to an incorrect path specified in the `content` option of the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when the path provided in the `content` option of the Tailwind CSS configuration file doesn't match the actual location of your HTML, JSX, or other files where you are using Tailwind classes. This typically results in Tailwind failing to detect and process these classes, leading to them being ignored or generating errors.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Try to use Tailwind classes in your application.
4. Observe that the classes are not being applied or are producing errors in the browser console.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying and correcting the path provided in the `content` option to correctly point to the directories containing your project's files where Tailwind classes are used.
